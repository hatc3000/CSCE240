To run this program in VSCode you must add Prog1/src and Prog2/src to source locations.  This program must be run from Prog_Assignments folder to properly access the correct data paths for the HTML files.

This program designates user queries based on substrings contained in their input.

For example if the user enter's, "Where does she live?".  The chatbot will see that the query contains where and live and return her home address.  This is all within an if else branch for a variety of different requests.

If the request can not be handled it will be channeled to the else statement which will tell the user that they do not know the answer and restart the loop.

There's two try catch blocks in the decisionTree class.  One is in case there's an error while converting hte input to all lowercase.  The second is in case the error inputs an unsupported string and the if else branches can't process it.

All information crashed my computer so I shortened it to basic information.
